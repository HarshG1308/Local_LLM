Sentiment Analysis Project

`  `# Overview

This project is designed to perform sentiment analysis on product reviews using a BERT-based model. It includes scripts for preprocessing data, training a sentiment analysis model, and deploying the model through a user interface for easy interaction. The user interface is available in both Streamlit and Tkinter versions, providing flexibility for different deployment scenarios.

`  `# Project Structure

`        `nlp\_model.py: Contains the class SentimentModel for loading a pretrained sentiment analysis model and predicting sentiment on new text inputs.

`        `requirements.txt: Lists the required packages for this project.

`        `text\_preprocessing.py: Script for preprocessing raw review data into a format suitable for training the sentiment analysis model.

`        `user\_interface.py: Provides a user interface for interacting with the sentiment analysis model. Two versions are included: one using Streamlit and another using Tkinter.

`        `README.md: (This file) Provides an overview and instructions for using this project.

`  `# Setup and Installation

`        `Clone the repository to your local machine.

`        `Ensure you have Python installed, preferably version 3.7 or above.

`        `Install required packages using pip:

`        `Copy code: pip install -r requirements.txt

`        `Download and place your trained model and its configuration file in the specified directory.


`        `Preprocessing Data: 

`        `Use text\_preprocessing.py to preprocess your raw data. The script will clean the data and prepare it for model training or prediction.

`        `Copy code: python text\_preprocessing.py



`        `Training the Model: 



`        `The training process has been outlined in the commented sections of nlp\_model.py. To train your model, ensure your preprocessed data is ready.

`        `Uncomment the model building, compilation, and training sections in nlp\_model.py.



`        `Run the script:

`        `Copy code  : python nlp\_model.py



`        `Running the User Interface

`        `Streamlit Version:

`        `To run the Streamlit app, navigate to the directory containing user\_interface.py and run: shell

`        `Copy code: streamlit run user\_interface.py



`        `Tkinter Version:

If you prefer a desktop application, uncomment the Tkinter version in user\_interface.py and run the script:



`        `Copy code: stramlit run “Path to user\_interface.py”







` `Alternate Methods: 



`        `Model Training:

`            `The project includes an alternate approach to model training, which involves customizing the number of labels, compiling the model with specific optimizer settings, and saving the trained model. This approach is detailed in the commented sections of nlp\_model.py and involves functions for building, compiling, training, and saving the model.

`        `Data Preprocessing:

`            `An alternate preprocessing method that includes stop word removal is commented out in text\_preprocessing.py. This method is more thorough and may lead to better model performance by reducing noise in the training data.

`        `User Interface Alternatives: 

`            `The project provides two user interface options: Streamlit and Tkinter. Streamlit offers a web-based UI that is easy to use and deploy, while Tkinter provides a traditional desktop application experience. The choice between them depends on the end-user preferences and deployment considerations.

Reproducing Results

`        `To reproduce the results:

`        `Train the model using the provided data or your own dataset.    

`        `Run the user interface and input your own text to see the sentiment predictions.

`        `command: streamlit run "Path to user\_interface.”
